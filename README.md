# Period.

## Introduction

We live in an incredibly misogynistic world where any product or service that revolves around menstruating is meant to disguise and hide the experience which feeds into a culture of shame and embarrassment around menstruation. Although there are apps out there that help people track their cycle, this app helps people track their cycle AND builds a social platform to create community and celebrate this way too long misunderstood experience! You can use this app to view your own cycle predictions, as well as view cycle predictions for your friends, share posts, and interact with other users, all in a space meant to support safer dialogue!
